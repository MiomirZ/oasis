                        <p>Step off the train all alone at dawn
                            <br>Back into the hole where I was born
                            <br>The sun in the sky never raised an eye to me
                            <br>The blood on the trax and they must be mine
                            <br>The fool on the hill and I feel fine
                            <br> Don't look back 'cause you know what you might see
                            
                            <br><br>Look into the wall of my mind's eye
                            <br>I think I know, but I don't know why
                            <br>The questions are the answers you might need
                            <br>Coming in a mess, going out in style
                            <br>I ain't good looking but I'm someone's child
                            <br>No-one can give me the air that's mine to breathe
                            
                            <br><br>I met my maker, I made him cry
                            <br>And on my shoulder he asked me why
                            <br>His people won't fly through the storm
                            <br>I said, "Hey, listen up man, they don't even know you're born"
