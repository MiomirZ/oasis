                    <h2>MUSICAL INFLUENCES</h2>
                    <p>Oasis was heavily influenced by British rock and pop music of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as by the Manchester music scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some of the band's primary musical influences include:

                        <br>The Beatles: Oasis's music is often compared to that of The Beatles, and the band members have cited them as a major influence. Many of Oasis's songs feature catchy melodies and harmonies, similar to those found in The Beatles' music.
                    
                        <br>The Rolling Stones: Oasis has also been heavily influenced by The Rolling Stones, particularly in their earlier, more rock-oriented music. The band's swagger and attitude have been compared to that of The Stones.
                    
                        <br>The Kinks: Oasis has cited The Kinks as a major influence, particularly in their use of British cultural references and social commentary in their lyrics.
                    
                        <br>The Who: Oasis has also been influenced by The Who's hard-hitting rock sound and their use of anthemic choruses.
                    
                        <br>The Stone Roses: The Stone Roses were a major influence on the Manchester music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Oasis was no exception. The band's use of jangly guitars and danceable rhythms were reminiscent of The Stone Roses.
                    
                        <br>The Jam: The Jam were another influential British band for Oasis, particularly in their punk-inspired energy and socially conscious lyrics.
                    
                        <br>The Smiths: The Smiths were known for their literate, often melancholic lyrics, and Oasis has cited them as an influence on their own songwriting.
                    
                        <br>T. Rex: Oasis has also been influenced by the glam rock sound of T. Rex, particularly in their use of simple, catchy guitar riffs.
                    
                    Overall, Oasis drew on a wide range of British rock and pop influences, blending them together to create their own unique sound.</p>
