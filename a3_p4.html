                        <p>Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
                            <br>I've got a lot of things to learn
                            <br>Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
                            <br>Before my heart starts to burn
                            
                            <br><br>So what's the matter with you?
                            <br>Sing me something new
                            <br>Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
                            <br>They only seem to come and go away

                            <br>I've found a key upon the floor
                            <br>Maybe you and I will not believe in
                            <br>The things we find behind the door

                            <br><br>If you're leaving will you take me with you?
                            <br>I'm tired of talking on my phone
                            <br>There is one thing I can never give you
                            <br>My heart will never be your home
