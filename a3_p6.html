                            <br>Come and make me my day
                            <br>The clouds around your soul
                            <br>Don't gather there for nothing
                            <br>But I can chase them all away
                            <br>Why do you need a reason for to feel happy
                            <br>Or shining for the rest of the world
                            <br>Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy
                            <br>Get your shit together girl
                            
                            <br><br>You've got a feeling lost inside you
                            <br>It just won't let you go
                            <br>Your life is sneaking up behind
                            <br>It just won't let you go
                            <br>No it just won't let you go

                            <br>Come dancing with me, 'cause to me it doesn't matter
                            <br>If your hopes and dreams are shattered
                            <br>When you say something you make me believe
                            <br>In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
                            <br>She knows exactly what she's worth
                            <br>She knows exactly what she's worth to me
                            <br>But I can see, I can see
                            
                            <br><br>If you ever find yourself inside a bubble

                            <br>Now you know you're not alone
