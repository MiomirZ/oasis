                            <br>Shout it from the rooftops of your head
                            <br>Make it sort of mean something
                            <br>Make me understand or I'll forget
                            <br>The people here on life's beaches
                            <br>They wish upon the waves that hide the sand
                            <br>Let them know that life teaches
                            <br>You to build a castle in your hand

                            <br>It's calling out beyond the grave
                            <br>And we're the fire in the sky
                            <br>We're getting better man!
