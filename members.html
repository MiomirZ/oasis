                    <h2>LIAM GALLAGHER</h2>
                    <p>Liam Gallagher is a British musician and songwriter, born on September 21, 1972, in Manchester, England. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the iconic British rock band Oasis, which he formed in 1991 with his older brother Noel Gallagher.

                        Liam's distinctive singing style and on-stage persona, characterized by his swagger, attitude, and confrontational behavior, helped propel Oasis to international stardom during the 1990s Britpop era. The band's debut album, "Definitely Maybe," released in 1994, became the fastest-selling debut album in UK history at the time, and established them as one of the most important acts of their generation.
                        
                        <br><br>Over the next decade, Oasis released several critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums, including "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" and "Be Here Now," and enjoyed a fierce but often tumultuous rivalry with fellow Britpop band Blur.
                        
                        In 2009, following years of infighting and public feuds between Liam and Noel, Oasis disbanded. Liam went on to form a new band, Beady Eye, and released two albums before disbanding in 2014. He then launched a successful solo career, releasing his debut solo album, "As You Were," in 2017, which debuted at number one in the UK charts.
                        
                        Throughout his career, Liam has remained a colorful and controversial figure, known for his outspoken views, heavy drinking, and occasional run-ins with the law. Despite this, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation, and his music continues to resonate with fans around the world.</p>

                    <h2>GUIGSY</h2>
                    <p>Guigsy, whose real name is Paul McGuigan, is a British musician, born on May 9, 1971, in Manchester, England. He is best known as the bassist of the iconic British rock band Oasis, which he co-founded with Liam and Noel Gallagher in 1991.

                        Guigsy's bass playing provided the backbone for Oasis' sound, anchoring the band's driving rhythms and catchy melodies. He played on all of Oasis' albums up until their third studio album, "Be Here Now," released in 1997.
                        
                        In addition to his role as a bassist, Guigsy also served as a songwriter for Oasis, co-writing several tracks with Noel Gallagher, including "Fade Away" and "Digsy's Dinner."
                        
                        Guigsy left Oasis in 1999, citing personal reasons, but remained on good terms with the band and continued to contribute to their music in various capacities. After leaving Oasis, he retired from the music industry and focused on his personal life.
                        
                        Throughout his career, Guigsy was respected for his contributions to Oasis' music and his understated but crucial role in the band's success. <BR><BR>He remains a beloved figure among Oasis fans and is remembered as a key member of one of the most influential bands of the 1990s. McGuigan occasionally performs as a DJ. He declined to appear in the 2004 Definitely Maybe DVD, although a polite letter explaining his reasons for doing so appears as a hidden extra and there is also a short segment featuring pundits giving their views on him.[5] He also declined to be interviewed for the 2016 Oasis: Supersonic documentary, though archive footage of him was used instead.

                        McGuigan said of his playing style in 1995, "When I first started I just played up and down the top string of the bass. Come to think of it, that's what I still do now."</p>

                <h2>TONY MCCARROLL</h2>
                <p>Tony McCarroll is a British musician, born on June 25, 1971, in Manchester, England. He is best known as the original drummer of the iconic British rock band Oasis, which he co-founded with Liam and Noel Gallagher in 1991.

                    McCarroll's powerful drumming style helped define the early sound of Oasis, providing the driving beats that propelled the band's rock anthems. He played on the band's debut album, "Definitely Maybe," which was released in 1994 and went on to become one of the best-selling albums of the decade.
                    
                    Despite his contributions to Oasis' early success, McCarroll was famously fired from the band in 1995, amidst tensions with the Gallagher brothers and allegations of substance abuse. He subsequently filed a lawsuit against the band, which was settled out of court in 1999.
                    
                   <br><br> After leaving Oasis, McCarroll pursued a career in music and released his memoir, "Oasis: The Truth," in 2010, which detailed his experiences in the band and the events that led to his departure.
                    
                   On the last day of April 1995, McCarroll's departure was announced and he was replaced by Alan White, who remained until 2004.

                   Oasis producer Owen Morris said of McCarroll, "Tony was quiet and always polite to me, but seemed out of his depth…so I think Tony did well to survive as long as he did in Oasis". Morris described McCarroll's drumming style as "extremely basic", but with timing and tempo that were "almost autistically perfect". Throughout his career, McCarroll has remained a beloved figure among Oasis fans, who credit him with helping to create the band's signature sound. Despite the acrimony that surrounded his departure, he continues to be remembered as an important member of one of the most influential bands of the 1990s.

                <h2>ALAN WHITE</h2>
                <p>Alan White is a British drummer, born on May 26, 1972, in County Durham, England. He is best known for his work as the drummer for the iconic British rock band Oasis, which he joined in 1995 following the departure of Tony McCarroll.

                    White's powerful and versatile drumming style helped define the sound of Oasis during their peak years in the late 1990s, and he played on several of the band's most successful albums, including "Be Here Now" and "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants."
                    
                    In addition to his work with Oasis, White has also played with several other notable musicians and bands, including Paul Weller, The Who, and Tom Jones. He has been praised for his technical proficiency and his ability to adapt his playing style to suit a wide range of musical genres.
                    
                    <br><br>White left Oasis in 2004, following the band's tumultuous recording sessions for their sixth studio album, "Don't Believe the Truth." He subsequently formed his own band, Alan White & The White House, and has continued to work as a session musician and producer. On the other hand, Oasis producer Owen Morris described White as "essentially a jazz drummer" who "was always shuffling away on his snare [...] and never hitting the basic back beats in a big dumb rock and roll way", feeling that he did not understand Oasis' sound as well as McCarroll. At the time of his departure White was the longest-serving member in Oasis beside the Gallaghers (he was later passed by Gem Archer and Andy Bell) and passed through thick and thin with the brothers despite being struck down several times with bouts of alleged tendinitis during his later years with the band.</p>
