                    <p>Paul McGuigan, Paul Arthurs, Tony McCarroll and Chris Hutton form a band called the Rain. Unsatisfied with Chris, they hired a new singer, Liam Gallagher. He later invited his older brother Noel, who was a roadie for Inspiral Carpets. Noel joined after agreement that he would be the main songwriter. Oasis was born.</p>

                        <p>After two years of playing live gigs with few songs that Noel had written, Oasis was discovered by Alan McGee and Creation Records. Alan didn't really plan to go on that gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, but he went. After hearing Oasis, he approached Noel and just asked him if he wants a record deal. Noel was shocked, he wasn't sure if he's been serious. After few months Oasis had a record deal.</p>

                      <p>Definitely Maybe had three recording sessions. They just couldn't capture their "massive" sound from their live gigs. Noel almost gave up everything, he wanted to release record even though he knew it wasn't good, but Alan said they have to do this album right. New producer came in, Owen Morris. He just turned everything "up" in the mix. Owen really understood how Oasis sounded, even though he just met them. Album had four singles, and it became one of the greatest debut albums of all time.</p>

                        <p>Oasis went to do a promotional tour around the world. They went to Japan, and later in USA. Americans didn't feel the vibe Oasis brought, beacuse it was so different from the whole grunge thing that was happening there. In the USA had happened famous Oasis gig at The Whisky-A-Go-Go in Los Angeles. The whole band took crystal meth, which resulted in a worst possible way. Liam hit Noel with tambourine while they were on stage, so Noel decided to quit the band, and flew to San Francisco without telling anyone where's he going. Few days later he was back with the band.</p>

                      <p>In April 1995 band released a single "Some Might Say", which remarked Tony McCarroll's last appereance with the band. He was replaced by Alan White. Band recorded all of the songs in about two weeks. There were a couple of incidents in the studio between two brothers. Reason for that was that Liam brought people from the bar in the studio while Noel was recording. (What's The Story)Morning Glory became even biggest hit than Definitely Maybe. It became one of the best-selling albums in the UK, selling over 23 million copies.

                        <p>On 27th and 28th April 1996 Oasis played concerts at Maine Road football stadium. That was a stadium of Manchester City F.C., a club that Gallagher brothers have been supporting since childhood. On August 3rd and 4th 1996 the band played their biblical concert at Knebworth House. 2.5 million people applied for tickets, but only 250 000 were sold. That gig still holds a record in UK for largest demand for a show. There was no turning back for the band, they were sensation all-over the world. That created a hype around the band. Around this time they developed their famous phrase: "mad fer it".</p>

                      <p> At the time of making Be Here Now Oasis were at top of the world. Be Here Now was bands most anticipated album. It was a commercial success, but Noel expressed regret for making it. He said that he didn't put much effort in it as in the first two albums. The sessions were filled with drugs, and the recording was rushed beacuse of the hype that was built around this record. Liam believes it is a 10/10 album. After making this album Bonehead and Guigsy have left the band.

Noel told in 2008 that there is more inspired music on The Masterplan than is on the Be Here Now. After that band took their first ever break, up until 1999 when they reunited together again.</p>

                          <p> In 1999 band started working on their fouth album. They found the replacement for Guigsy and Bonehead, Gem Archer on guitar and Andy Bell on bass. Andy never played a bass before, so he had to learn it(he played guitar before joining Oasis). Standing on the Shoulder of Giants marked a new era in bands history, because they dropped their usual sound, exploring more psychodelic rock on this record. The other thing that played a key role for change in their sound is closing of Creation Records. Because of that band decided to open their own record label, calling it Big Brother Recordings.

They didn't perform that night, and two hours later after the gig was supposed to happen, Noel announced on the web-site that he is quitting Oasis. Remaining members continued under the name Beady Eye, while Noel was forming his solo project, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Beady Eye disbanded in 2014, when Liam started his solo carrer.
